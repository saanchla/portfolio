      A little about me. I am a curious, self-driven designer who is passionate in
      emerging technologies and advocating UX design across all fields of work. Having
      studied psychology in my undergrad, I worked as a recruiter for nearly 2 years.
      During my tenure, I had the opportunity to meet a diverse range of people and
      developed a keen ability to tangibly assess their skill set and apply that towards
      my clientsâ€™ needs. Most importantly, I learned to make the candidate the focus of
      the process. At BrainStation I learned how to use this skill within the field of UX.
      I look forward to continue to apply this knowledge in new and challenging ways. When
      I'm not wireframing, I like taking different dance classes, and indulging my love
      for trying new foods.
